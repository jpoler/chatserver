the chatserver will have the ability to server up to n clients

qor serialization scheme, use a circular buffer.
to pack message: [one byte for messagelength, 30 bytes for username which will be '\0' terminated, maximum message length of 128] 

basically, get a socket, bind to a port, listen

then use a select to figure out which sockets are readable

if the server socket becomes readable, accept, add the new socket to
master set

if any other socket becomes readable, read the message and send to everyone
but the receiving socket and server socket

worry about serialization later???
